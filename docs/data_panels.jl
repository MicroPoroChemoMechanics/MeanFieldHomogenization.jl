# The data a page reads, shown where it reads them.
#
# A page that loads a file of `data/literature/` shows its content folded under
# the block that loads it, as a page shows the scripts it includes
# (`source_links.jl`): what was transcribed, from where, and how it was checked,
# laid out as a card and tables rather than as the JSON itself. A page that uses
# entries of a thermodynamic database shows which ones, by identity only: the
# databases are not ours to redistribute. Included by `make.jl`, after
# `source_links.jl`, whose `source_url` it reuses.
#
# Each function returns a `Base.HTML`, emitted by an `@example` block whose only
# line ends in `# hide`, so that the page shows the panel and no code.
