# ── Partial builds: `MFH_DOCS_ONLY` ──────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The full site costs well over an hour, nearly all of it inside `@example`
# blocks, so a change touching one page pays for every other. This builds only
# the pages whose path contains one of a comma-separated list of patterns:
#
#     MFH_DOCS_ONLY=theory/hill_tensors julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
#     MFH_DOCS_ONLY=manual/,theory/     julia --project=docs docs/make.jl
#
# FILTERING `pages` IS NOT ENOUGH, and this is the whole reason the file exists.
# Documenter's `SetupBuildDirectory` walks the **source directory** and adds
# every `.md` it finds; `pages` only decides the navigation. Pruning the page
# tree alone leaves every `@example` on the site still running. What does work is
# giving Documenter a different source tree, in which a kept page is linked
# rather than copied (Documenter walks with `follow_symlinks = true`), and a
# page tree filtered to match.
#
# WHAT A PARTIAL BUILD PROVES: that the `@example` blocks of the pages it kept
# run, and that those pages render.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT PROVE, and says so: anything about links or about docstring
# coverage. Every `@ref` into a pruned page points at nothing, and every
# docstring whose API page was pruned is "missing", so `cross_references` and
# `missing_docs` are demoted to warnings for that build only, the draft
# pre-flight is skipped, and deployment is refused. The full build, with
# `warnonly` kept down to `[:docs_block]`, is the only one that deploys.
#
# `index.md` and `references.md` are always kept: the site root the navigation
# is rendered around, and the page every citation on a kept page resolves into.
#
# THE THIRD PIECE IS IN `docs/src/.vitepress/config.mts`. Demoting
# `cross_references` makes Documenter emit the unresolved references literally,
# and VitePress refuses to build over dead links. Its `ignoreDeadLinks` is
# therefore driven by this same environment variable, so that the Julia half and
# the Node half of one decision cannot disagree.
#
# Ported from ChemistryLab's `docs/partial.jl`, which records how each of these
# rules was learned.

A temporary directory mirroring `srcdir`, with the Markdown pages the filter

Pages are linked and everything else is COPIED. Julia's `cp` reproduces a
symlink as a symlink, so a linked `.vitepress/config.mts` would let
DocumenterVitepress, which fills that file's `REPLACE_ME_DOCUMENTER_VITEPRESS`
markers in what it believes is the build copy, write straight through the link
and overwrite the template in the repository. That happened once in
ChemistryLab.
